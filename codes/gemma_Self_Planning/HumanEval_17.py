# The problem requires parsing a string of musical notes and converting them into a list of integers representing their beat durations.
# We need to iterate through the string, identify each note type ('o', 'o|', or '.|'), and map it to its corresponding beat value (4, 2, or 1).
# The function should return a list of these beat values in the order they appear in the input string.
