# The problem asks us to calculate the sum of the digits of a number N in binary representation,
# and then convert that sum back into its binary representation as a string.
# We will first convert N to binary, then sum the digits (which are 0s and 1s), and finally convert the sum to binary.
def solve(N):
    """Given a positive integer N, return the total sum of its digits in binary.
    
    Example
        For N = 1000, the sum of digits will be 1 the output should be "1".
        For N = 150, the sum of digits will be 6 the output should be "110".
        For N = 147, the sum of digits will be 12 the output should be "1100".
    
    Variables:

             Constraints: 0 ≤ N ≤ 10000.
    Output:
         a string of binary number
