# The problem asks to find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array within a given array of integers.
# We can use Kadane's algorithm to solve this problem efficiently. Kadane's algorithm is typically used for finding the maximum sub-array sum,
# but we can modify it to find the minimum sub-array sum by tracking the minimum sum so far instead of the maximum sum.
# The core idea is to iterate through the array and keep track of the current minimum sum ending at each position and the overall minimum sum encountered so far.
