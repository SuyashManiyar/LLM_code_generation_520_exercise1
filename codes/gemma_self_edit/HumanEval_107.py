# The problem requires us to find the number of even and odd integer palindromes within a given range (1, n) and return them as a tuple.
# To achieve this, we will iterate over the range and check each number to see if it's a palindrome, then count the even and odd palindromes separately.
# We can use a simple loop to iterate over the numbers, convert each number to a string to easily check if it's a palindrome, and use the modulus operator to determine if a number is even or odd.

def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        # Convert the number to a string to easily check if it's a palindrome
        str_i = str(i)
        # Check if the number is a palindrome
        if str_i == str_i[::-1]:
            # Check if the number is even or odd and increment the corresponding count
            if i % 2 == 0:
                even_count += 1
            else:
                odd_count += 1
    # Return the counts as a tuple
    return (even_count, odd_count)

# Test the function
print(even_odd_palindrome(3))  # Output: (1, 2)
print(even_odd_palindrome(12))  # Output: (4, 6)
