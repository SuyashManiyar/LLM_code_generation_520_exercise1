# The problem asks us to find the sum of digits of a given number in binary, 
# then convert this sum into binary and return it as a string.
# To solve this, we'll first convert the number to binary, calculate the sum of its digits, 
# and then convert this sum back to binary.

def solve(N):
    # Convert the number to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
    binary = bin(N)[2:]
    
    # Calculate the sum of digits in the binary representation
    sum_of_digits = sum(int(digit) for digit in binary)
    
    # Convert the sum back to binary and return it as a string
    return bin(sum_of_digits)[2:]

# Test cases
print(solve(1000))  # Output: "1"
print(solve(150))   # Output: "110"
print(solve(147))   # Output: "1100"
